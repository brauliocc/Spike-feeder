# Spike-feeder

Spike is a bearded dragon. every week he has to eat a certain amount of food. this is a calculator that lets me figure out the total sum of food he needs to eat. for example x crickets y super worms z horn worms. there should be a bearded dragon ascii art and it gets happy when your combined food adds up to his weekly intake. let me input each quanitity of food source manually. there should be a bar that shows if im under or lver the weekly intake or judt right. 

bottom left add a gear for settings that lets me overwrite calculations:

example (dont use this search it up)
total = 20 crickets
1 super worm = 5 cricket
1 horn worm = 10 cricket
etc 
other food options apply and let me be able to add more
